/*
JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

*/

let a=10;
if(a%2==0){
    console.log("even")
}else{
    console.log("odd");
}

let $sample = 10;
console.log("Js allow the '$' symbol for identifiers  ")

// let a-b = 10; epade loosu thanam panna epade than kari thupum note it...

// JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.

/*

Hyphens:

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

console.log("\uD83D\uDE0D")

// const m =10;
// m=20;
// error cannot reassign constant
